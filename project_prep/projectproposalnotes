Ask TA/Instructors:
Situation w/ Astrid - if we should put any limitations on her involvement, or just keep open for all of project week
Keep space!
How should we organize our Github Issues?
By Day?
By User Stories
All UXs - how to implement these in code
More often what a PM will give you on the job
By Feature?
Our project may be too simple to do by feature
Depends on projects, what best method is.
Broadest way is done and in progress.
Nicholas like to do Done, In Progress, and Days
Try to scope out where those fit into the days

Stretch - using keypresses - spacebar and return

Nick’s tips:
Constructor for a user stays the same

If everything is modular - can run shadow hands in the background. Can deal out hands in the background, making stretch goals easier, especially counting cards.
Track index 0 of players

Counting card logic - different styles of 21 in Vegas
Having a full table will fulfill this. Also they use two decks, which can change your card counting methods.

One deck before reshuffle - 1-2 hands. Check vegas poker rules. Do we implement those roles, or a switch between them?

QA Tester for app, with a deck of cards - Michael A., David.
Saturday, testing rounds?

Coding in preventing a user from getting a triple or quadruple split (if we’re able do the split stretch goal)
