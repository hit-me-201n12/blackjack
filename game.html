    <div class = "rulesText" id = "popUp">The object of Blackjack is to beat the dealer.<br><br> The player begins their turn with two cards, then chooses to either hit (space bar) or stay (return).<br><br> When the player hits, they receive a card and that card's value is added to their hand total.<br><br> Neither player nor dealer's cards may total more than 21. If that happens, it's called a bust.<br><br>If the player's first two cards = 21, they have a 'natural blackjack' and automatically win the hand.<br><br>The dealer must draw cards until they have a 17.<br><br>So, a good way to win in Blackjack is to make the dealer bust. Unlike you, the dealer can't stand on a hand that totals under 17. <br><br><br>Remember that there are no near-misses in this game.<br><br> Good Luck!<br><br>
